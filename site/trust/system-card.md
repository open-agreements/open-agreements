# OpenAgreements System Card

Evidence snapshot (UTC): `2026-02-23T19:47:47.704Z`

## Executive Summary

<div class="trust-summary-banner">
<h2>Moderate signal; review caveats</h2>
<p>132 of 132 spec scenarios are mapped to tests. 1,745 automated checks were recorded, with 2 non-passing outcomes.</p>
</div>

- This card focuses on reliability signals developers can scan quickly.
- Scope: all OpenAgreements packages including the core CLI, contracts-workspace, and MCP connector.

## Key Results

### 1) OpenSpec Scenario Mapping

This is **spec scenario mapping coverage**, not line/branch code coverage.

| Metric | Value |
|---|---:|
| Spec scenarios | 132 |
| Mapped to tests | 132 |
| Unmapped | 0 |
| Coverage | 100.0% |
| Capabilities measured | 2 |

No unmapped scenarios were found in the currently measured scope.

### 2) Automated Test Run Status

| Metric | Value |
|---|---:|
| Recorded checks | 1,745 |
| Passing | 1,743 |
| Non-passing | 2 |
| Skipped | 0 |
| Last observed update (UTC) | 2026-02-23T19:47:47.704Z |

## Discussion

- A high mapping percentage means each spec scenario is represented by at least one test.
- A high pass rate means recent automated runs did not surface failures in the current result set.
- Both signals should be read together, along with known limitations below.

## Limitations

- This card does not report line or branch code coverage.
- Mapping coverage can be 100% and defects can still exist.
- Run-status counts depend on the current contents of the allure-results directory; stale results should be cleaned before release reporting.

## Appendix: Methods (Technical)

- Mapping numbers are read from the generated OpenSpec traceability matrix.
- Run-status numbers are read from `allure-results/*-result.json` files.
- This page is regenerated by running `npm run generate:system-card`.
