# OpenAgreements System Card

## Executive Summary

<div class="trust-summary-banner">
<h2>All 215 spec scenarios mapped to tests</h2>
<p>215 of 215 OpenSpec scenarios are mapped to automated tests across 2 capabilities.</p>
</div>

- This card focuses on reliability signals developers can scan quickly.
- Scope: all OpenAgreements packages including the core CLI, contracts-workspace, and MCP connector.

## Key Results

### 1) OpenSpec Scenario Mapping

This is **spec scenario mapping coverage**, not line/branch code coverage.

| Metric | Value |
|---|---:|
| Spec scenarios | 215 |
| Mapped to tests | 215 |
| Unmapped | 0 |
| Coverage | 100.0% |
| Capabilities measured | 2 |

No unmapped scenarios were found in the currently measured scope.

### 2) Live Signals

| Signal | Link |
|---|---|
| Allure test report | [tests.openagreements.ai](https://tests.openagreements.ai) |
| Code coverage (Codecov) | [![Coverage](https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/open-agreements/open-agreements/main)](https://app.codecov.io/gh/open-agreements/open-agreements) |
| CI status | [![CI](https://github.com/open-agreements/open-agreements/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/open-agreements/open-agreements/actions/workflows/ci.yml) |
| npm downloads | [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/open-agreements.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/open-agreements) |

## Discussion

- A high mapping percentage means each spec scenario is represented by at least one test.
- Live test run data (pass rates, failure details) is available in the [Allure report](https://tests.openagreements.ai).
- Both signals should be read together, along with known limitations below.

## Limitations

- This card does not report line or branch code coverage.
- Mapping coverage can be 100% and defects can still exist.

## Appendix: Methods (Technical)

- Mapping numbers are read from the generated OpenSpec traceability matrix.
- Live test data is published to GitHub Pages on every push to main.
- This page is regenerated by running `npm run generate:system-card`.
