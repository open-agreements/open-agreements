          <details>
            <summary>What is OpenAgreements?</summary>
            <p>
              OpenAgreements is an open-source CLI and library for filling standard legal agreement templates
              (DOCX) with structured inputs. It is designed to work directly with coding agents and local workflows.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Does OpenAgreements send agreement data to remote servers?</summary>
            <p>
              The core tooling is local-first. Template fill runs on your machine and outputs local files.
              You control any external services you choose to connect.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>What templates are supported today?</summary>
            <p>
              The project includes internal templates (for example Common Paper and Bonterms), external vendored
              templates (for example YC SAFEs), and recipe-driven templates downloaded from official sources at runtime.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Can I use OpenAgreements with Claude Code or other agent workflows?</summary>
            <p>
              Yes. You can use the CLI directly, install the Agent Skill, and connect the workspace MCP package for
              lifecycle-focused contract organization workflows.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>How is template licensing handled?</summary>
            <p>
              Licensing is enforced by template metadata and validation rules. Non-derivative sources are kept
              unchanged, and non-redistributable sources are handled through recipe instructions and runtime download.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>What is the contracts workspace package?</summary>
            <p>
              It is a separate package for organizing contract directories by lifecycle, generating status indexes,
              and validating folder/file conventions without requiring template fill adoption.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>How do I deploy this landing page to Vercel?</summary>
            <p>
              Import this GitHub repository into Vercel and deploy the root project. The included <code>vercel.json</code>
              serves the static <code>site/</code> directory as the deployed output.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Does OpenAgreements replace legal counsel?</summary>
            <p>
              No. OpenAgreements automates document assembly and workflow structure. Teams should still involve qualified
              legal counsel for legal advice, negotiation strategy, and jurisdiction-specific interpretation.
            </p>
