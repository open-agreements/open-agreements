        <div class="faq-list">
          <details>
            <summary>What is OpenAgreements?</summary>
            <p>
              OpenAgreements is an open-source CLI and library for filling standard legal agreement templates
              (DOCX) with structured inputs. It is designed to work directly with coding agents and local workflows.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Does OpenAgreements send agreement data to remote servers?</summary>
            <p>
              The core tooling is local-first. Template fill runs on your machine and outputs local files.
              You control any external services you choose to connect.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>What templates are supported today?</summary>
            <p>
              The project includes internal templates (Common Paper, Bonterms, and employment packs), external vendored
              templates (YC SAFEs), and recipe-driven templates (NVCA Series A documents) downloaded from official sources at runtime.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Can I use OpenAgreements with Claude?</summary>
            <p>
              Yes. Add <code>https://openagreements.ai/api/mcp</code> as a connector in Claude
              (Settings &rarr; Connectors &rarr; Add custom connector) and you can list templates,
              fill agreements, and download DOCX files directly from the chat.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>How is template licensing handled?</summary>
            <p>
              Licensing is enforced by template metadata and validation rules. Non-derivative sources are kept
              unchanged, and non-redistributable sources are handled through recipe instructions and runtime download.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>What is the contracts workspace package?</summary>
            <p>
              It is a separate package for organizing contract directories, generating status indexes,
              and validating folder/file conventions. The <code>init</code> command previews a topic-first
              structure and suggests setup actions without auto-creating folders, so your team or AI agent
              stays in control.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Can OpenAgreements generate .docx NDAs and Cloud Services Agreements?</summary>
            <p>
              Yes. OpenAgreements can generate editable <code>.docx</code> agreements from template inputs, including
              Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) and Cloud Services Agreements (CSAs), with local-first workflows that
              keep output files in your own workspace.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Can I use OpenAgreements as an AI contract generator for startups?</summary>
            <p>
              Yes. OpenAgreements is built for agent-assisted contract drafting from structured prompts and form inputs.
              Startup teams can generate first-pass agreements in <code>.docx</code>, then review and negotiate them with counsel.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Can I generate mutual and one-way NDA templates in Word format?</summary>
            <p>
              Yes. OpenAgreements includes NDA templates and can output editable Word <code>.docx</code> files for mutual
              and one-way NDA workflows.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Can I generate Cloud Services Agreements with or without SLA terms?</summary>
            <p>
              Yes. OpenAgreements supports Cloud Services Agreement template variants, including flows that include SLA
              terms and flows that omit SLA terms, all in editable <code>.docx</code> output.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Can I edit and redline generated contracts in Word or Google Docs?</summary>
            <p>
              Yes. Outputs are standard <code>.docx</code> files, so your team and counterparties can review, redline,
              and negotiate in normal document tools.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Can OpenAgreements track contract lifecycle status like drafts and executed files?</summary>
            <p>
              Yes. The contracts workspace package helps organize folders by lifecycle (for example forms, drafts,
              incoming, executed, and archive) and generate status indexes for quick review.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>How can I verify OpenAgreements is actively maintained and tested?</summary>
            <p>
              Public trust signals include passing CI checks, Codecov coverage with patch/project gates,
              Vitest-based test runs, and OpenSpec-to-Allure traceability checks that map canonical scenarios
              to executable tests.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Can I generate employment offer letters and IP assignment agreements?</summary>
            <p>
              Yes. OpenAgreements includes employment templates for offer letters, IP/inventions assignments,
              and confidentiality acknowledgements. The fill pipeline can also generate a jurisdiction-aware
              employment memo with compliance notes and disclaimers.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>What are computed recipe profiles?</summary>
            <p>
              Recipes can include a <code>computed.json</code> file that derives fill values from user inputs
              using conditional rules. For example, the NVCA Stock Purchase Agreement recipe computes
              dispute-resolution defaults and governing-law alignment automatically based on the selected
              jurisdiction and mode.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Does OpenAgreements replace legal counsel?</summary>
            <p>
              No. OpenAgreements automates document assembly and workflow structure. Teams should still involve qualified
              legal counsel for legal advice, negotiation strategy, and jurisdiction-specific interpretation.
            </p>
