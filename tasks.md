Draft virtual showcase entry (OpenAgreements):
Title: OpenAgreements - Open-source legal agreement generation for Claude Code
One-liner: Fill 36 standard agreement templates through interactive prompts or MCP and export professionally formatted DOCX files in minutes.
What we built: OpenAgreements combines a CLI and MCP endpoint so users can choose a template, answer guided questions, and generate sign-ready legal documents with formatting preserved.
Why it matters: Legal and ops teams move from blank page to production-grade contract drafts faster, with repeatable structure and lower drafting overhead.
Demo flow: Choose template -> Fill details via prompts/MCP -> Download final DOCX.
