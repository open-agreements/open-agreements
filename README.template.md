Fill standard legal agreement templates and get signable DOCX files. OpenAgreements includes 40+ templates across NDAs, cloud service agreements, employment docs, contractor agreements, SAFEs, and NVCA financing documents.

Works with Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Cursor, and local MCP or CLI workflows.

## Install

### Agent Skill (recommended)

```bash
npx skills add open-agreements/open-agreements
```

### Claude Hosted MCP

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http open-agreements https://openagreements.ai/api/mcp
```

### Gemini CLI Extension

```bash
gemini extensions install https://github.com/open-agreements/open-agreements
```

### CLI

```bash
npm install -g open-agreements
```

Or run directly with zero install:

```bash
npx -y open-agreements@latest list
```

## Quick Start

### With Claude Code

Ask Claude:

```text
Fill the Common Paper mutual NDA for my company
```

Claude can discover templates, interview you for field values, and render a signed-ready DOCX.

### With the CLI

```bash
# See all available templates
open-agreements list

# Fill a template from a JSON data file
open-agreements fill common-paper-mutual-nda -d values.json -o my-nda.docx

# Fill with inline values
open-agreements fill common-paper-mutual-nda --set party_1_name="Acme Corp" --set governing_law="Delaware"
```

### Example Prompts

- "Draft an NDA for our construction subcontractor"
- "Create a consulting agreement for our insurance agency"
- "Fill the independent contractor agreement for a freelance designer"
- "Generate a SAFE with a $5M valuation cap"

### What Happens

1. The agent runs `list --json` to discover templates and their fields.
2. It interviews you for field values grouped by section.
3. It runs `fill <template>` to render a DOCX preserving the source formatting.
4. You review and sign the output document.

### Cursor

This repository includes a Cursor plugin manifest at `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` with MCP wiring in `mcp.json`.

### Local Vs Hosted Execution

- **Local**: `npx`, global install, or stdio MCP. Processing happens on your machine.
- **Hosted**: `https://openagreements.ai/api/mcp`. Template filling runs server-side for faster setup.

Choose based on document sensitivity and internal policy. See the trust checklist below for the data-flow summary.
